Phase 1: Mastering Core Prompting Principles (Target: First 3 Weeks)
This phase is dedicated to completing the course and building a solid foundation in the core techniques of prompt engineering.
[ ] Complete the "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" Course:
[ ] Guidelines & Principles: Learn the two key principles for writing effective prompts: being specific and giving the AI time to "think."
[ ] Iterative Development: Master the iterative process of refining prompts to get progressively better results for coding tasks.
[x] Environment Setup:
[x] Install and configure GitHub Copilot and the Gemini CLI/IDE extensions.
[x] Set up a practice project to apply the course learnings in a real coding environment.

Phase 2: Applying Prompting Techniques to the Coding Workflow (Target: Weeks 4-8)
In this phase, I will systematically apply the specific techniques learned in the course to my daily development tasks.
[ ] Utilize Core Course Capabilities:
[ ] Summarizing: Use the AI to summarize complex legacy code, long error messages, or technical documentation to speed up comprehension.
[ ] Inferring: Ask the AI to analyze code snippets to infer potential bugs, identify performance bottlenecks, or explain logic.
[ ] Transforming: Leverage the AI for code transformation tasks, such as:
Refactoring code to a different design pattern.
Translating code snippets from one programming language to another.
Converting a function to be asynchronous.
[ ] Expanding: Generate comprehensive code from a short description. For example, expand a simple comment into a full class structure, API documentation, or a set of unit tests.

Phase 3: Advanced Application and Automation (Ongoing)
This final phase focuses on using the most advanced concepts from the course to build robust solutions and optimize team workflows.
[ ] Build a "Chatbot" for a Specific Task:
[ ] Apply the principles from the course's "Chatbot" module to create a specialized, conversational assistant for a common task. For example, a "debugging bot" that guides a developer through troubleshooting steps.
[ ] Develop a Personal Prompt Library:
[ ] Create and maintain a collection of highly effective prompts for our team's specific needs (e.g., "Generate a React component with this structure," "Write a unit test for this service using Jest").
[ ] Share Best Practices:
[ ] Document and share successful prompt engineering patterns and techniques with the team to help elevate everyone's efficiency.
